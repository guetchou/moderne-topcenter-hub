I don't see the original content of `src/components/AppointmentForm.tsx` in the code you shared. Without seeing the original code that was meant to replace `// ... keep existing code`, I cannot reconstruct the complete file.

To help you, please share the original content of `src/components/AppointmentForm.tsx` and I'll help you merge it with the AI's changes to create the complete, working code.
